An exploratory analysis of a player base at $.5/1 for Run It Once Poker.  
## Assignment  
For this assignment, I was tasked with implementing a specified rakeback system and also one of my own.  
My goal was to produce a system which outpreformed the given one according to several criteria.  
Run It Once is an established company in the poker industry who will soon launch their software for hosting  
online poker games. Rake is the percentage of each pot attributed to Run It Once and rakeback is the player  
reward. In this context, rakeback is the rake percentage returned to the players for playing on the Run It  
Once platform. For more information on the analysis and results, please see the writeup.
